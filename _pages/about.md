Studying and conducting research using Paleomagnetism to analyze and characterize the behavior of the Earth's ancient magnetic field. Formerly, I served as a computational software engineer, gaining expertise in seismology, geophysical signal processing, geophysical computation, and geophysical inverse problems. My experience also encompasses data collection through web scraping and software development. Over the past 4 years, I've developed proficiency as a developer, particularly in scientific software as well as in general software realm, including web development. Proficient in Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
